# conDAQtor: Directing the lab orchestra

**The problem**

The home-written software that labs need to acquire data determines the possibilities of the experiment. 
Knowledge about such software is not shared between PhD generations or research groups, resulting in a lack of continuity and time-consuming duplicated efforts.

**My goal**

Make research more efficient by offering support and training to researchers, while building a national network for knowledge transfer according to FAIR principles.

**Expected results**

Faster, more advanced experiments. Improved software reusability, and a strong network of labs that accumulate and share expertise.

**How you can help the project**

Provide feedback on the feasibility of the project, and support for the next steps towards realizing the project through a funded position.
