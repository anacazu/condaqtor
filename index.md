**The problem**

The home-written Data Acquisition (DAQ) software that labs need to acquire data determines the possibilities of the experiment. Therefore, it is key for researchers. However, 
knowledge about such software is often not shared between research groups or even between PhD generations, resulting in a lack of continuity and time-consuming duplicated efforts.

**My goal**

Make research more efficient by offering support and training to researchers, while building a national network for knowledge transfer according to FAIR principles.

**Expected results**

Faster, more advanced experiments. Improved software reusability, and a strong network of labs that accumulate and share expertise.

**How you can help the project**

Provide feedback on the feasibility of the project, and support for the next steps towards realizing the project through a funded position.
